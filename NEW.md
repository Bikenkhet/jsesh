# What's new in JSesh (VERSION NUMBER HERE)

- when text is selected, the "explode group" command will act on selection instead of acting on the text before caret.
- Now, R8A and nTrw use the exact same shape
- MdC "nn" has now a "Gardiner-like" code : M22B ; it will be normalized as such.
- nTrw and M22B will now be "normalized" as R8A and M22B


**normalized** means that exports which try to give a canonical rendering of MdC text (and which remove phonetical codes and use Gardiner codes instead) will use the Gardiner code version.
