## About the signs from J-Y Barré's texts

There are many sign variants included in Jean-Yves Barré's texts.
You might have noticed that I'm a bit conservative as far as sign list extension go.
Most of those signs are perfectly legitimate, but I'd rather take some time before adding them.
The signs are included in the text library. 
You can set the folder `texts/KV34/Complements-KV34` as Hieroglyphic folder in JSesh preferences to display them.
