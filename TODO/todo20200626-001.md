# Fix I18N support on Mac ?

With Java 9 (at least with AdoptOpenJdK), it seems
that the Prefered Language information is passed as environment variable.

It works when starting JSesh from the command line, but not when starting JSesh
as an application on the Mac. Hence, all texts are in english.

The best way would probably be to allow the user to choose the language interactively.
