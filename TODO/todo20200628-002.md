# Understand and fix performance problem in finitestate library

The search is rather slow when using the "max match length" feature.

- Experiment to see if we are correct about the search being in O(n) - with perhaps a huuuge factor in front.
- Understand why it is slow
- See if alternate representation of "maxlength" in finitestate would work
- Else, see if writing a variant of search with a limit as argument would not be easier and more efficient.
